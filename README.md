# CryptoBrain Architecture

This document outlines an enhanced modular architecture for CryptoBrain. The design maximizes the usage of third-party connectors to handle most data acquisition, processing, and execution tasks, while keeping the local multi-agent Analyzer lean. This approach reduces development overhead and leverages robust external services, leaving only minimal, essential local processing for actionable insights.

## Key Roles

- **Connector:**  
  Interfaces with external, trusted services (e.g., social media, market data, airdrop aggregators) to fetch and deliver real-time data and functionality. By maximizing the use of connectors, we ensure robust integration and lower maintenance while delegating most heavy processing externally.

- **Analyzer (Local Multi-Agent Module):**  
  A lean, local module designed to process and refine data received from connectors. It employs lightweight agents—including LLM-based components—to correlate, filter, and generate actionable insights. The Analyzer remains minimal by offloading intensive tasks to connectors.
