# CryptoBrain Architecture Design

## Overview

CryptoBrain leverages robust third-party connectors for data acquisition and action execution while keeping a minimal local Analyzer module for essential data processing. This architecture maximizes the usage of external services to handle most data-intensive tasks, ensuring reliability and scalability while reducing development overhead. The project is developed in Python and is designed to run on your local machine using Docker for containerization and an available database for persistent storage.

## Key Roles

- **Connector:**  
  Interfaces with external, trusted APIs and services (e.g., social media, market data, airdrop aggregators) to fetch and deliver real-time data and functionality. By maximizing the use of connectors, we ensure robust integration and lower maintenance while delegating most heavy processing externally.

- **Analyzer (Local Multi-Agent Module):**  
  A lean, local component written in Python that processes and refines data from connectors. It employs lightweight agents—including optional LLM-based components—to correlate, filter, and generate actionable insights. The Analyzer remains minimal by offloading intensive tasks to connectors.

   - Confidence levels assigned to each recommendation with explicit reasoning.
   - Optional human-in-the-loop approval for high-risk actions.

4. **Execution:**  
   - Automated connectors carry out actions such as posting content, notifying about airdrop opportunities, or executing trades.
   - Transaction verification and confirmation mechanisms ensure actions are completed.
   - Audit logging of all automated actions for transparency and debugging.

5. **Monitoring & Feedback:**  
   - A centralized dashboard aggregates insights from all modules for continuous monitoring.
   - Performance metrics track the effectiveness of each module and the system as a whole.
   - Feedback loops allow the system to learn from past decisions and improve over time.

## Scalability & Future Extensions
