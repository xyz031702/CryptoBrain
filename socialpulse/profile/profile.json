    "short_description": "Revolutionizing open-source software (OSS) by mapping its 'genetic code' to enhance security, traceability, and decentralized value creation.",
    "detailed_description": "The Software Genome Project (SGP) reimagines software as a genomeâ€”comprising distinct, traceable elements like code, models, and data. By applying genetic mapping, SGP enables robust security audits, transparent asset tracking, and a tokenized reward system that quantifies and incentivizes open-source contributions. Leveraging blockchain-based tokenized licensing, NFT ownership, and decentralized governance, SGP fosters a trust-driven ecosystem. Integrated with Decentralized Science (DeSci) and powered by AI agents, it unlocks sustainable value for OSS communities and developers worldwide.",
    "core_value": "Treating software as a genetic blueprint to ensure traceability, foster decentralized trust, and sustain OSS ecosystems through AI-driven analytics and blockchain governance.",
